| <div style="width:50px">Group</div> | <div style="width:70px">Command</div> | <div style="width:200px">Description</div> | Brief command usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auth | client | Generate Mix auth tokens with client credentials | **mixcli** **auth** **client** [-h] [--client-id MIX_CLIENT_ID] [--service-secret MIX_SERVICE_SECRET] [--out-type OUTPUT_TOKEN_TYPE] [--out-file OUTPUT_TOKEN_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.auth**</br>module **client** | MixCli **auth** command group **client** command.<br/><br/>This command performs the Oauth client credential authorization workflow, as instructed in Mix official documentation.It is not necessary to run this command before running any other MixCli commands. Such authorization process will berun behind the scene should MixCli commands need authorization tokens.<br/><br/>This command is mostly useful for 1) generating working Mix API auth tokens for the uses of other programs; 2) triagingif the client credentials from users are working. |
| channel | get | Get Mix project channel info in Json | **mixcli** **channel** **get** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.channel**</br>module **get** | MixCli **channel** command group **get** command.<br/><br/>This command will retrieve channels' configuration information from Mix projects, referred by IDs. The configs of Mixprojects' channels/targets will be mostly used when users want to create 'new' Mix projects whose channels/targets'configs are exactly same as the source/reference projects. By doing so clients that have been coupled with thesource/reference projects can be easily ported for coupling of 'new' projects.<br/><br/>The implementation of this command is being used by project command group, cp-create command. |
| concept | list | List concepts for Mix project NLU models | **mixcli** **concept** **list** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l aa_AA_LOCALE [--with-predef] [--need-meta] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.concept**</br>module **list** | MixCli **concept** command group **list** command.<br/><br/>This command will retrieve meta information of all entities in NLU ontology of a Mix project. Users can chooseto take list of entity names or JSON of entity meta info as finalized output.<br/><br/>One note here is the currently there are three special NLU entities: YES_NO, DATE, and TIME. They will alwayscreated for users when new Mix projects are created but they are NOT built-in nuance entities. |
|  | rm | Remove concept for Mix project NLU models | **mixcli** **concept** **rm** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l aa_AA_LOCALE -c CONCEPT_NAME |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.concept**</br>module **rm** | MixCli **concept** command group **rm** command.<br/><br/>This command will remove an NLU entity from NLU ontology of a Mix project. |
| config | create | Create new build config for a context tag and optionally deploy | **mixcli** **config** **create** [-h] (--ns NAMESPACE_NAME &#124; --ns-id NAMESPACE_ID) [--cfg-group APP_CONFIG_GROUP_NAME] --ctx-tag APP_CONTEXT_TAG_NAME -p PROJECT_ID -l aa_AA_locale [-n NLU_MODEL_BUILD_VERSION]<br/>                            [-a ASR_MODEL_BUILD_VERSION] [-d NLU_MODEL_BUILD_VERSION] [--deploy &#124; --deploy-cfg DEPLOYMENT_JSON_STR] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.config**</br>module **create** | MixCli **config** command group **create** command.<br/><br/>This command is useful when used to create a 'new' application configuration for a namespace,e.g. zhuoyan.li@nuance.com, a Mix app config group, e.g. MySampleApps, a context tag, e.g. AC1245_4586,from a Mix project, referred by ID. If no arguments on which models should be deployed, all of ASR/NLU/DLGmodels will be included. If no arguments on which build versions of models should be deployed, or 0 is used,the latest build version of models will be included.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: The **config tag** specified for this command must be an **EXISTING** tag. For the momentthis command can **NOT** create a new tag. Users would have to manually create their tags first in Mix dashboard UIif they want new ones.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, at least one of {nlu,asr,dlg}-(model)version needs to be specified, as at least one model needs tobe included in a deployment. Use number **0** to refer to **latest** build version of models.<br/><br/>The argument '--do-deploy' accounts for the operations ofselecting 'new' build config in Mix MANAGE UI and clicking 'promote' to actually deploy models to servers.<br/><br/>The '--locale' argument is mandatory when NLU models are included in deployment. |
|  | lookup | Lookup app config meta | **mixcli** **config** **lookup** [-h] (--ns NAMESPACE_NAME &#124; --ns-id NAMESPACE_ID) [--config-group APP_CONFIG_GROUP_NAME] --context-tag APP_CONFIG_TAG_NAME [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] [--save-globalsearch] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.config**</br>module **lookup** | MixCli **config** command group **lookup** command.<br/><br/>This command is used to lookup meta information on a particular Mix app configuration, with theconstraints of namespace, also app config group and context tag where the config belongs to.<br/><br/>This command is actually more intended to be used either internally by other commands, or used for lookup metainfo necessary to run app new-deploy command.<br/><br/>Please note that this command can perform 'global' search: Search namespaces of which the authorized accountis not a member. Such 'global' search will result in significant response latency and a response payload of considerablesize (~15Mb). The argument glblsrch_totmp is intended to be used only to triage this feature for development purpose. |
|  | rm | Remove all app configs for (namespace, config group, context tag) and the optionally context tag | **mixcli** **config** **rm** [-h] (--ns NAMESPACE_NAME &#124; --ns-id NAMESPACE_ID) [--config-group APP_CONFIG_GROUP_NAME] --context-tag APP_CONFIG_TAG_NAME [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] [--rm-tag] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.config**</br>module **rm** | MixCli **config** command group **rm** command.<br/><br/>This command is useful for removing all existing configs under a particular context tag.<br/><br/>Currently Mix platform does not offer UIs to removing more than one config in given context tag with some push-buttonfashion UIs. If there are more than one app config under a context tag and user wants to remove all of them, userwould have to use the remove/delete UI for every config iteratively and manually. This is rather annoying and thiscommand offers a batch-removal solution.<br/><br/>Please note there are some considerations when use this command:<br/><br/>1.  As designed in current Mix platform, when a context tag is created, it is always created with a particular app    config, which we can call as 'root config'. That being said, uses may not create an empty context tag with NO app    configs at all. Any new app configs created for that context tag afterwards will be created as **child configs**    of the **root config**.2.  Regarding the **root configs**, there are certain special attributes from empirical observations    2.1     A **root config** may not be removed/deleted when there are existing child app configs;    2.2     When the **root configs** are removed/deleted, the context tags will also be removed/deleted by themselves.            That being said, if users want to keep context tags, they must keep the associated **root configs**.3.  There may have been an app config in a context tag that has been deployed/promoted to servers. If that is the case,    this command will fail with exceptions. Users would have to firstly remove the **promotion** in Mix UI    manually. This will be one-off action as there could be only one deployed/promoted config in a context tag. |
| dlg | export | Export Mix project DIALOG model as Json | **mixcli** **dlg** **export** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -o OUTPUT_JSON [-T EXPORT_FILENAME_TMPLT] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.dlg**</br>module **export** | MixCli **dlg** command group **export** command.<br/><br/>This command will export dialog model of a Mix project as JSON artifact. If the 'out-json' argument is a directory,a file name <PROJ_ID>\_\_<PROJ_NAME>\_\_DIALOG\_\_<DATETIME>.json will be created in that output dir.<br/><br/>Please note that Mix API endpoint will take some considerable processing time on the request before sending backthe response payload.The content of the payload is that JSON artifact. |
|  | import | Import artifact into Dialog models for project, currently only JSON | **mixcli** **dlg** **import** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -s IMPORT_SRC_FILE [-w] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.dlg**</br>module **dimport** | MixCli **dlg** command group **import** command.<br/><br/>This command will import a JSON artifact, which should be result of a dialog model export of Mix projects. The importwill completely override the current dialog model of destination Mix project. (Please note there is NO guarantee thatthe dialog model after import will be consistent with the NLU model of the destination project.)<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that Mix project dialog model import is a blocking process. Requests to API endpoints willonly return when import jobs are completed, as contrast to NLU TRSX import actions. |
|  | try-build | Do run-time trial build of Dialog model for project | **mixcli** **dlg** **try-build** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-w] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.dlg**</br>module **try_build** | MixCli **dlg** command group **try-build** command.<br/><br/>This command will do a run-time test build of DLG models. It is equivalent to the model building whichis activated when users click 'Try' button in Mix.dialog UI.<br/><br/>This would be particularly useful to test if Dialog models would build successfully, before running 'project build'command to actually build the Dialog models.<br/><br/>Please note that Mix API endpoint will take some considerable processing time on the request. |
| grpc | export | Export NLU model to a TRSX file | **mixcli** **grpc** **export** [-h] -c EXPORT_CONFIG -g MIX_GRPC_PYPATH [MIX_GRPC_PYPATH ...] [-r GRPC_RESOURCE_AVAILABLE_TO_EXPORT] -o OUTPUT_FILE |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.grpc**</br>module **export** | This command makes use of Mix gRPC API(s) to export/download specific deployed models (NLU/ASR/Dialog)from Mix SaaS gRPC service.<br/><br/>Please note that we expect users to provide Python dependency packages/libraries which are necessary toconnect to Mix gRPC service, most particularly the "grpc(-io)" package and the Mix gRPC API Python proto stub.We do not include those dependencies as dependency requirement for MixCli, nor expect Python environmentthat runs MixCli to have those dependencies installed. |
| intent | list | List intents for Mix project NLU models | **mixcli** **intent** **list** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l aa_AA_LOCALE [--need-meta] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.intent**</br>module **list** | Mix **intent** command group **list** command.<br/><br/>This command is useful to get information about intents in a locale of NLU model for Mix project. |
| job | list | List Mix job(s) for project by project ID | **mixcli** **job** **list** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.job**</br>module **list** | MixCli **job** command group **list** command<br/><br/>This command is not really expected to be used by users directly. The implementation codes arebeing used by other commands. |
|  | status | Check Mix job status by job ID | **mixcli** **job** **status** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -j JOB_ID [-s] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.job**</br>module **status** | MixCli **job** command group **status** command<br/><br/>This command is not really expected to be used by users directly. The implementation codes arebeing used by other commands. |
|  | wait | Wait for Mix job to complete either successfully or failed | **mixcli** **job** **wait** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -j JOB_ID [--err-on-failed] [--infinite &#124; -t TIMEOUT_IN_SECOND] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.job**</br>module **wait** | MixCli **job** command group **wait** command<br/><br/>This command is not really expected to be used by users directly. The implementation codes arebeing used by other commands. |
| nlu | export | Export NLU model to a TRSX file | **mixcli** **nlu** **export** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l aa_AA_LOCALE [-t NLU_EXPORT_TYPE] -o OUTPUT_FILE [-d DATA_TYPES_IN_EXPORT [DATA_TYPES_IN_EXPORT ...]] [-e] [-r] [-T EXPORT_FILENAME_TMPLT] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.nlu**</br>module **export** | MixCli **nlu** command group **export** command.<br/><br/>This command will export NLU model, from a particular locale, including particular data elements, of a Mix projectas TRSX artifact. If the 'out-file' argument is a directory,a file name <PROJ_ID>\_\_<PROJ_NAME>\_\_nlu\_\_<DATETIME>.json will be created in that output dir.<br/><br/>TRSX artifacts of NLU models from Mix projects can contain (training) samples, ontology, entities and theirliterals and values. If no arguments are specified all elements would be included in TRSX exports. |
|  | import | Import artifact into NLU models for project, currently only TRSX | **mixcli** **nlu** **import** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-l LOCALE_TO_IMPORT] -s IMPORT_SRC_FILE [-t IMPORT_ARTIFACT_TYPE] [-W] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.nlu**</br>module **nimport** | MixCli **nlu** command group **import** command.<br/><br/>This command will import a TRSX artifact, which should be result of a NLU model export of Mix projects. The importwill be sort of incremental merging processing between the current NLU model and the one represented by TRSX. If thereare conflicts between the two, such as same training sample in both current NLU model and TRSX, non-fatal errors willbe raised and that sample will be skipped for import.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that Mix project NLU model TRSX import is asynchronous process. Mix platform will createasynchronous import jobs and meta info of those jobs will be returned as response payload. It is users'responsibility to query appropriate Mix API endpoints to keep track of the status of those jobs.<br/><br/>This in turn introduces an important feature of this nlu import command: If users specify '--wait' argument, thiscommand will do the tracking routine for users: Receive the response payloads to extract import job IDs, keep queryingAPI endpoints for the status of jobs, and only return when jobs are completed, either 'completed' for success or'failed' for failure. The tracking of job status is done with the implementations of job list/status/wait commands. |
|  | trsx2qnlp | Convert TRSX model to QuickNLP project | **mixcli** **nlu** **trsx2qnlp** [-h] -s SRC_TRSX -o OUTPUT_DIR -l TRSX_LOCALE -u MIX_USERNAME |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.nlu**</br>module **trsx2qnlp** | MixCli **nlu** command group **import** command.<br/><br/>This command will import a TRSX artifact, which should be result of a NLU model export of Mix projects. The importwill be sort of incremental merging processing between the current NLU model and the one represented by TRSX. If thereare conflicts between the two, such as same training sample in both current NLU model and TRSX, non-fatal errors willbe raised and that sample will be skipped for import.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that Mix project NLU model TRSX import is asynchronous process. Mix platform will createasynchronous import jobs and meta info of those jobs will be returned as response payload. It is users'responsibility to query appropriate Mix API endpoints to keep track of the status of those jobs.<br/><br/>This in turn introduces an important feature of this nlu import command: If users specify '--wait' argument, thiscommand will do the tracking routine for users: Receive the response payloads to extract import job IDs, keep queryingAPI endpoints for the status of jobs, and only return when jobs are completed, either 'completed' for success or'failed' for failure. The tracking of job status is done with the implementations of job list/status/wait commands. |
|  | try-train | Train the run-time trial NLU model | **mixcli** **nlu** **try-train** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l LOCALE [-W] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.nlu**</br>module **try_train** | MixCli **nlu** command group **try** command.<br/><br/>This command would replicate the 'Train Model' function in Mix.nlu UI to train a run-time NLU model for testingannotations on utterances. |
|  | try-utt | Try to annotate utterance with latest run-time NLU model | **mixcli** **nlu** **try-utt** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l LOCALE (-u UTT_TO_TRY &#124; -uf FILE_OF_UTT_TO_TRY) [-o OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.nlu**</br>module **try_utt** | MixCli **nlu** command group **try** command.<br/><br/>This command would replicate the 'Try' function in Mix.nlu UI to get a trial annotation from the latest run-timeNLU model, if exist. |
| ns | list | List all affiliated namespace(s) for the user represented by auth token | **mixcli** **ns** **list** [-h] [-t] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.ns**</br>module **list** | MixCli **ns** command **group** list command<br/><br/>This command would list all affiliated namespaces for the user account represented by auth token.Affiliated namespace is one namespace of which the user account is a member. |
|  | search | Search namespace ID for given name | **mixcli** **ns** **search** [-h] -n NAME_OF_NS_TO_LOOKUP [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] [-t] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.ns**</br>module **search** | MixCli **ns** command group **search** command<br/><br/>This command would search meta info for a given namespace.<br/><br/>Please note this command would search for arbitrary namespace, not only those namespaces of which the representeduser account is a member. That being said, this command is effectively an extended version of ns list command.<br/><br/>Lookup in this command is accomplished in two phases: The first phase is to search the given namespace name fromthe namespaces affiliated with the represented user account, actually done by calling the implementation inns list command.<br/><br/>If no affiliated namespace is of name that matches the given name, this command will execute a global search:search the given namespace name from all namespaces in Mix platform. Please note that although such 'global search'has only been tested with an account with global PS privilege. it is believed that this global search would alsowork for regular accounts.<br/><br/>This command is not really intended to be used by users. Instead the implementation of this command is used by'ns' command groups. For example, 'ns new-deployment' command needs such to create deployment configs for arbitrarynamespaces: Creating deployment configs in namespaces would require Mix IDs of namespaces in API requests' payloads.That being said, when users use namespace names as arguments in 'ns new-deployment' command, that command needsprocesses to lookup namespace IDs with the names. |
| project | build | Launch model builds for Mix project | **mixcli** **project** **build** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-m MODEL_TO_BUILD [MODEL_TO_BUILD ...]] [-l LOCALE] [--nlu-mode NLU_MODEL_TRAIN_MODE] [-n BUILD_NOTE] [-W] [-e EXPORT_FILEORDIR] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **build** | MixCli **project** command group **build** command<br/><br/>This command would launch model builds for a Mix project. Please note to launch NLU model builds, ifspecified, command line argument 'locale' is mandatory. Furthermore the build note will be set for allmodel builds, same as in Mix UI. Last but not least, same as in Mix UI, model building jobs will be submittedas asynchronous jobs and then API responses will be returned. If argument 'wait' is specified, this command will workas blocking calls, i.e. will not return until all launched jobs are completed.<br/><br/>One particular highlight of this command is the ability to export the NLU/dialog models, if they have been includedin model builds, to artifacts, which can then be preserved. This is technically an automation of completing modelbuilds, and then run 'nlu export' and 'dlg export' commands. The purpose of doing such is to preserve the model sourcestogether with particular build versions of model builds, not just the built models. This would serve as workaroundsto make possible versioning and branching processes for Mix NLU/dialog models, a feature currently not yet availablein Mix platform.<br/><br/>Clarification: Currently Mix platform can roll back ASR/NLU/Dialog models of Mix projects to history build versions.However it is impossible to roll back the model sources to the status when those builds were created. Therefore norebase nor branch are possible. |
|  | build-stat | Get model build stats for Mix project | **mixcli** **project** **build-stat** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-m MODEL_TO_QUERY [MODEL_TO_QUERY ...]] [--latest] [--version] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **build_stat** | MixCli **project** command group **build-stat** command.<br/><br/>This command would retrieve meta info of build history of Mix project.<br/><br/>This command is not really intended to be used by users. The implementation of this command will be usedby other commands for model build related processes. |
|  | cp-create | Create new Mix project by copying source project | **mixcli** **project** **cp-create** [-h] --name NEW_PROJECT_NAME --src-proj-id SRC_PROJ_ID_TO_CP (--dest-ns NAMESPACE_NAME &#124; --dest-ns-id NAMESPACE_ID) [--asr-dp-topic ASR_DATAPACK_TOPIC_NAME] [--copy-nlu]<br/>                                [--copy-dlg] [--copy-models] [--workdir MODEL_COPY_WORKDIR] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **copy** | MixCli **project** command group **cp-create** command.<br/><br/>This command would create 'copies' of given source Mix project. By 'copies' the settings on NLU locales,ASR/DLG datapack topic name (this can be overriden), and dialog channels/targets, will be replicated. Replicationof those settings are particularly useful to move any existing backends/clients, which are coupled with sourceMix project, so as to couple with the new copies conveniently. The greatest merit of this command is it removesthe need to visually copy those settings from source project in project creation steps, if doing so in Mix UI.<br/><br/>Please note that this command currently does NOT copy over the ASR/NLU/dialog models from source project. Usersstill need to, possibly first export those models from source, import model exports from source project to completefull copying. |
|  | create | Create new Mix project | **mixcli** **project** **create** [-h] --name PROJECT_NAME -t ASR_DP_TOPIC -l LOCALES [LOCALES ...] [-c CHANNEL_CONFIG_JSON_LITERAL] (--ns NAMESPACE_NAME &#124; --ns-id NAMESPACE_ID) [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **create** | MixCli **project** command group **create** command.<br/><br/>This command would create new Mix projects with given specifications, such as names of new projects, locales of NLUmodels, containing namespaces, and etc. It is effectively what users would do in Mix UI project creation steps.<br/><br/>One note is that this command may not seem so convenient if used to create dialog applications, where users need tocreate complicated channels/targets configurations, as the command asks for literal JSON content to denote the configs,which would be difficult to produce in command line. It has been implemented this way due to the expectation of MixAPI endpoints for requests. If users of this command are not focus on dialog aspects of new projects, simply skip the'channel' argument and the default omni-channel will be created as default config. |
|  | get | Get Mix project meta info in Json | **mixcli** **project** **get** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **get** | MixCli **project** command group **get** command.<br/><br/>This command will retrieve meta information for Mix projects, referred by IDs.<br/><br/>This command is not expected to be used by users directly, except that they want to extract useful meta info forpurpose of automation flows. Many of commands in MixCli use the implementation codes in this command. |
|  | model-export | Export models (currently NLU/DLG) for a project by calling {nlu,dlg} export commands. | **mixcli** **project** **model-export** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID [-l aa_AA_LOCALE] [-m PROJECT_MODEL_TO_EXPORT [PROJECT_MODEL_TO_EXPORT ...]] [-T EXPORT_FILE_TMPLT] -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **model_export** | MixCli **project** command group **model-export** command.<br/><br/>This command serves as a push-button automation of exporting multiple models, currently NLU/dialog, from Mix projects,effectively combination of 'nlu export' and 'dlg export' commands. |
|  | reset | Reset a Mix project | **mixcli** **project** **reset** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -c CONFIRM_PROJECT_NAME |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **reset** | MixCli **project** command group **reset** command.<br/><br/>This command immediately reset all the models of a Mix project, referred by IDs.<br/><br/>The author has NO ideas whether or not Mix users with privileges such as Global Admin and Global PS would be able toarbitrary Mix projects with this API, which implies great potential risks on any input errors for specifying projectIDs. For safe-guard purpose this command, and its implementation, asks for confirmation project names as input. Theconfirmation names must exactly match the names extracted from meta info, which are in turn retrieved with project IDs. |
|  | rm | Delete Mix project with ID | **mixcli** **project** **rm** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -c CONFIRM_PROJECT_NAME |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **rm** | MixCli **project** command group **rm** command.<br/><br/>This command removes/deletes a Mix project. Like 'project reset' command, we ask users to enter names of projectsto be removed in command line as safeguard measures to reduce chances of errors like entering wrong project IDs. |
|  | update-qnlp-prop | Update specific property to new value of native QuickNLP project for a locale of Mix project | **mixcli** **project** **update-qnlp-prop** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l LOCALE -k QNLP_PROPERTY_KEY -v QNLP_PROPERTY_NEW_VALUE [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.project**</br>module **update_qnlp_prop** | MixCli **project** command group **update-qnlp-prop** command.<br/><br/>This command will update the value of a given property (referred by key name) of native QuickNLPproject for a specific locale of specific Mix project.<br/><br/>Please note that for each locale of a Mix project, there is a underlying native QuickNLP project withwhich the NLU model is built. If there are two or more native QuickNLP projects, they are separated.So are their properties. As a result locale of Mix project must be specified in order to identify thespecific native QuickNLP project.<br/><br/>There are no easy ways to verify if a specific property in indeed available in QuickNLP. As aresult, we actually perform the validation after sending property update/assignment requests.If a specific property (key/name) does not exist for the QuickNLP project, sending updaterequests on it shouldn't change anything in the QuickNLP project.<br/><br/>This command is SUPPOSED to be used by advanced users who know what they are doing. |
| run | script | Run mixcli commands from script | **mixcli** **run** **script** [-h] --shell SCRIPT_IN_SHELLCMD [-v [VAR_SUB_PAIRS [VAR_SUB_PAIRS ...]]] [--dryrun] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.run**</br>module **script** | MixCli **run** command group **script** command.<br/><br/>This command would run sequences of MixCli commands from supported scripts. Currently this command supports the scriptsare prepared in tshell-script syntax files.<br/><br/>**Shell-script syntax files**: Those files are written in the same way as regular BASH shell scripts, except that<br/><br/>1. instead of BASH commands and/or executables, MixCli commands are used.<br/><br/>2. only supporting one line per command, no line-spanning<br/><br/>3. like shell-scripts, use '#' as first non-space char in the line to make the line as comment<br/><br/>The following content is an example script in shell-script syntax with three commands:<br/><br/> # check system version<br/> sys version<br/> # get project meta data and save command out to JSON file<br/> project get --project-id 11037 --out-file project_meta_11037.json<br/> # build the project<br/> project build --project-id 11037 --locale en-US --note 'Build from MixCli'<br/><br/>Please take note that if there is failing command in the middle of execution, command would stop the execution andall the remaining commands will be aborted. |
| sample | count | Count samples(s) for intent in a locale of NLU model | **mixcli** **sample** **count** [-h] -p PROJECT_ID -l NLU_LOCALE -i INTENT_NAME [--orig-resp] [-o RESULT_OUTPUT_FILE] |

|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.sys**</br>module **version** | MixCli **sys** command group **version** command.<br/><br/>This command will show Mix platform versions. It is actually useful for two aspects: Firstly serves as functionaltest on the end-to-end process of MixCli, i.e. acquiring auth tokens, sending API requests, receiving responsepayloads, and process them; secondly, if MixCli is run with some preset authorization tokens, this command can serve asvalidation process as we can probe Mix API services with those tokens to see if they are valid. |

|  | jsonpath | Process JSON file with given JsonPath query and show result | **mixcli** **util** **jsonpath** [-h] -i JSON_TO_PROC -j JSONPATH_QUERY [-f &#124; -P POSTPROC_PYTHON_EXPRESSION] [-J] |
|  | | implementation</br>pkg **mixcli.command.util**</br>module **jsonpath** | MixCli **util** command group **jsonpath** command.<br/><br/>This command will process a JSON file with a specified JsonPath query and send result to STDOUT.<br/><br/>This command accepts JsonPath queries that are supported by jsonpath-ng project at&nbsp;[https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng). One important note is thatPython JsonPath-ng always return a list, which could be empty, when JsonPath query matches none of values, or allvalues the query has matched.<br/><br/>To access the element(s) in the query result list, users may use the switch "--always-first" to have the commandalways post-process query results and extract the first element in the list, should list be non-empty.<br/><br/>On the otherhand, users may use "--postproc-pyexpr" to have a Python EXPRESSION to be evaluated on query result listand take evaluation result as end result. In the Python expression, use placeholder 'r' (case-sensitive) to refer tothe query result list. For example, **--postproc-pyexpr "r[0]"** would yield the same result as **--always-first**.Please NOTE the different betwwen EXPRESSION and STATEMENT. For example, **r[0]** is a supported expression,while **a=r[0]** is a **statement** which would not work. |
